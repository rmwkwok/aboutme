Hello! I am Raymond Kwok, and I am from Hong Kong. 
<br>
<br>
Being a business-oriented Data Scientist with software development background, I am experienced in customer analytics using causality, A/B testing, machine learning methods, programming and so on. With them, I fought my most unforgettable battle in 2018 in which I successfully boosted Lalamove's revenue in China by 10% month-on-month. 
<br>
<br>
At present, I am wrapping up for the last term of my Master degree and expecting to graduate in August 2021. This webpage will tell you more about me, especially my career, along with some of my user-oriented projects. I will be delighted to have further conversation with you.
