Hello! I am Raymond Kwok, and I am from Hong Kong. 

I am a business-oriented Data Scientist and interested in customer analytics using causality, A/B testing, machine learning methods, etc. With them, I fought my most unforgettable battle to successfully boost Lalamove's revenue in China by 10% month-on-month. Currently, I am finishing the last term of my Master degree and expecting to graduate in August 2021. 

I will be introducing myself to you using this webpage, especially my career, and some of my projects. If you are interested to have further conversation with me, please feel free to contact me. (rmwkwok at gmail dot com)
