#### TO DATA SCIENCE

After another 2 R&D roles in industry, I decided to pursue a different way to innovate - Data Science. While limitation in Hong Kong was a factor, my background, the rising of the field, accessibility to infrastructure, and growing of the community were all my driving forces. 

In 2018, I modeled Lalamove's customer data with Bayesian statistics, and built an A/B test system to run a daily campaign so that I could react to the market response data-driven-wise. We finally made a 10% MoM increase of revenue, not only because of the company's strong foundation, but my approach that allowed us to fine-tune our moves for a better and better return-on-investment.

To equip myself with the latest technology, I took a 5-course specialization in Deep Learning (organized by deeplearning.ai for which now I am an alpha test consultant), and finished a trip planning recommender for the capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate in 2019. I had three other moves in the same year. 

Firstly, I started to write data science blog, and shared my articles with Analytica Vidhya, receiving ~38,000 views and a 50% read-rate so far. Secondly, I began my Master of Science degree by the University of California, Riverside, specializing in Data Science. And lastly, I moved to Montenegro, a beautiful European country, for my first official Data Scientist position.
