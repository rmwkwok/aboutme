## Heuristic learning with triplet network (2021)
<div style="text-align: justify"><h4>
<em>for transfer-airport finding in interlining</em>
<br>
<br>
Achieved over 90.3% recall rate in learning transfer airports options based on > 1 million rule-based one-stop journeys. The method could be applied to learn users' patterns for making personalized interlining journey suggestions.
