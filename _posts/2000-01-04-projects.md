### Heuristic learning with triplet network
##### *for transfer-airport finding for flight interlining*
##### ABCDE

------

### Product search by photos
##### *5th place in an eBay competition and presented in the FGVC8 workshop*
##### Trained EfficientNet and a triplet network using > 1 million photos to search photos of the product given a photo of itself, and the query photo and the search photos could be taken from different angles. The technique could be useful for price-matching or recommendation.
