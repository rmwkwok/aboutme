#### FROM R&D
I started off my R&D career at the early stage of a frontier neutrino experiment located inside a nuclear power plant, working with people from the US, China, Russia, Japan, etc. 

It was the right job at the right time because I got to broaden my horizons and had unlimited room to strive for better and improve my skills in data analysis, software and hardware implementation. 

One day, my boss tasked me a sub-system, co-leading the design, construction, and maintenance of a gas supply system with a $60k budget to keep the neutrino detectors from the air and water. I presented in many review meetings, contacted 30+ parts suppliers, learned how to bend a copper pipe, and how to make serious mechanical drawings, etc. 

I could not forget the moment, after working days (underground) and nights (in hotel room), when the chief engineer looked at my work, the only word he said after a long silence - "amazing".
