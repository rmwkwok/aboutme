## FROM R&D

<div style="text-align: justify"><h4>
I started off my R&D career at the early stage of a frontier neutrino experiment inside a nuclear power plant, working with people from the US, China, Russia, Japan, and so on. 
<br>
<br>
It was the right job at the right time because it broadened my horizons and gave me unlimited room to strive for the best, polishing my skills in data analysis, software and hardware implementation. 
<br>
<br>
One day, my boss tasked me a sub-system, co-leading the design, construction, and maintenance of a gas supply system with a $60k budget to keep the neutrino detectors from the air and water.  I presented my design and progress in many meetings, contacted 30+ parts suppliers, learnt how to bend a copper pipe, and how to make quality mechanical drawings, and so on. 
<br>
<br>
I could not forget the moment, after days (underground) and nights (in hotel room) of endeavor, when the chief engineer looked at my work, the only word he said after a long silence - "Amazing".
