      title: "(The hostel staff made this welcome board for us.) <br> In the autumn of 2010, we bought a Taiwan travel guide book, watched a few YouTubes about how to fix bikes, and flew to Taipei to begin our first biking trip. Our goal was to circle around Taiwan once and finish this 1000km challenge in 9 days. I was very excited because we had not planned anything except for the flights and the bikes, and because it was a trip for the three of us."

      title: "Our first decision was whether to go clockwise or anti-clockwise on the island, and without much thought, we started clockwise, but we did not know we were going to bike a lot harder on the whole trip because of this. Very soon after leaving the city, we found we kept heading against the wind, which was so strong that I had to go full power even going downhill. However, there was no turning back, and so we rode until the sunset, when we began to look for a place to stay. Hotel information was not as convenient as today, but we still managed to find one with our guide book, our phone, and Google Maps. The first day was supposed to be for warm-up, but by the time we lied on beds, we were totally exhausted."

      title: "While the wind never left, nature gave us another challenge on the third day: a section of the road that we had to go along was blocked due to a landslide. Given the limited time and experience we had, we gave up completing the whole circling of the island by bike and took a train to bypass the blocked road. It was imperfect. However, some time after we touched the ground again, we saw a completely different scenary—at last, nature showed us its kindness—the greens, the river, and some warm-hearted people. At the same time, our legs were getting used to the new daily routine, and luck brought us to one of the most unforgettable hostels in my life that night, with a restaurant that provided the tastiest beef noodle."

      title: "(At the Shouka Biker Rest Stop.) <br> Our speed was going up day after day, and on the 5th day we could do 100km per day (I know it's not considered fast :P), and that was also the day we were about to climb our first mountain to the Shouka Biker Rest Stop at 460m. To us, it was more than just a checkpoint, but really like an achievement: we finally made it to the very place everyone had talked about on the internet :). "

      title: "(Watching the first sunset on the west coast.) <br> Shouka was the split point between the east and west sides of the island, so after that, I thought I could finally be relaxed because the west side was mainly cities and flat land, and everything indeed went quite well until, on the eighth day, my mistake brought me to the last challenge by nature and my biggest surprise in this trip."

      title: "(We had some buns in the morning) <br> I still remember the morning when we were having breakfast and the news talked about the monsoon, which went opposite to the direction we were heading, and because of that, I told my friends to stick to the main way and never ever think to deviate from that, and it was also where Murphy's law showed its power! I mistakenly deviated from that by making a wrong turn at an intersection. The good thing was that I was some distance ahead of my friends so they did not see me and follow me into the wrong way, but the bad thing was the wrong way led me straight to the coast where there were no trees to block the wind, and this time, even with my full power, I found it very extremely difficult to go downhill against the monsoon, and that was not it—we lost contact because we thought one phone card was enough."

      title: "(The drinks made my day.) <br> That was probably the most worrying moment of the trip because I did not know how to find them. I looked at the map, found the next intersection point on the main way to be 35km away, and concluded that I had to get there before my friends and wait for them. Thanks to the monsoon, I spent twice as much time as I thought to finally get there. While I was getting so nervous about missing them because of the longer riding time, I was really rushing to the intersection point, and to my very big surprise, our friends just showed up in my sight, riding very hard towards me! They would not understand why I was so happy running to them and almost stopping them to hug them (but they were still focusing on the uphill, so it was better not to stop them). After that, I treated myself to a big meal of Taiwanese snack food at a food stall, told my friends what happened, and the next beautiful thing was that the owner of the food stall sent her son to buy some drinks for us. I cannot forget that."

      title: "On the ninth day, we finally got back to where we rented our bikes and where we started. Although it rained for the first time on our trip, it was already nothing compared to what we had gone through. That night, we went back to the same hostel we had stayed in before we started, and we shared photos and stories with the hostel staff and another group of travelers. We raised to toast to our accomplishment, but the wine was literally like knocking me out—after a few sips, I simply couldn't wait to go to bed, and bed I went, and basically skipped all the celebration things we had thought about at the beginning.

      title: "In the last Round Taiwan Trip, I had to take a train to bypass a section of the road that was blocked due to a landslide. This time, my goal was to finally be able to claim that I had really biked around the whole island. With already some experience, I became the leader of this group of eight (mostly students) and planned the whole trip, including all of the logistics and accommodations, which made it my job to make sure we made it to our accommodations every single day."

      title: "As it was learnt from the last trip, we went anti-clockwise this time to make sure our warm-up happened on flat land on the west coast instead of the mountainous area on the east, so by the time we got to the Shouka Biker Rest Stop, we were ready to challenge the east coast!"

      title: "As we rode north on the east side, a typhoon was approaching close, and that really worried me because last time the landslide that blocked our road was caused by another typhoon, so I had to keep following the news every day and hoped nothing bad would happen."
